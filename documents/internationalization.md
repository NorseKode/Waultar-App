# Internationalization in the app

## Setup

The setup is completed and was done with [https://docs.flutter.dev/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization](this guide)

## How to setup localization in a new view
Take a look at this example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';

class GenericView extends StatefulWidget {
  const GenericView({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _GenericViewState createState() => _GenericViewState();
}

class _GenericViewState extends State<GenericView> {
  late AppLocalizations localizer;
  late ThemeProvider themeProvider;
  
  ...

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    localizer = AppLocalizations.of(context)!;    
    themeProvider = Provider.of<ThemeProvider>(context);
    
    return Container(
      child: Text(localizer.helloWorld)
      ...
    );
  }
}
```

## How to add a new translation
This requires altering to files located at the internationalization folder, with the required localization. This only special file is the app_en.arb, as it is the template file, with requires the following additions

```arb
{
    "helloWorld": "Hello World!",
    ...
    "myTranslation": "My Translation",
    "@helloWorld": {
      "description": "The conventional newborn programmer greeting"
    },
    ...
    "@myTranslation": {
      "description": "Description explaining if needed"
    }
}
```
While any other files only requires the first addition, like so:

```arb
{
    "helloWorld": "Hej Verden",
    ...
    "myTranslation": "Min Overs√¶ttelse"
}
```
